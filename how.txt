I have installed express, express-generator as module in app; they can be installed globally using -g option.
npm install express
npm install express-generator
express // to create files,directories to start with; like routes, bin etc... IT DOESN'T INSTALL DEPENDENCIES IN PACKAGE.JSON
npm install // it reads package.json and installs all dependencies
npm info socket.io version // if you don't know the version of package and want to put in package.json file
// added nodejs.nbm plugin to netbeans for nodejs support
// removed jade and added ejs as it looks fine as template
