files that get autoloaded:
in app/ models, routes will be auto loaded, config/ strategies by passport 
, public/modules, 

to run node in different env
$ NODE_ENV={The Environment Name} grunt
eg: NODE_ENV=development grunt

local directory structure for working
/apps/ contains link current which points to /apps/foodRedirect/food_saver 
or whereever you want to point it to.
this current is pointing to dpk22dev master as origin and techhackwarrior as 
upstream
/apps/TECHHACK contains git cloned with techhack account, 

config.assets field in the environments configuration files option allows you to 
organize all your assets inclusion in a single place.


 to exclude searching from directory:
grep -r --exclude-dir=node_modules gruntfile.js *


when we copied project from foodRedirect directory to food_saver, some files 
like .jshintrc weren't copied. so when grunt ran jshint, it complained about
statements with require, module etc... because jshint file describes what modules
to allow or not etc... info

without .bowerrc its bower installs in public/libs, but after reading .bowerrc 
it places accordingly

facebook login was giving error that:
Given URL is not allowed by the Application configuration.: One or more of the given 
URLs is not allowed by the App's settings. It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL,
 or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App's domains.

problem was that in advanced tab, it was taking wrong url as localhost:8080 but app
was running on localhost:3000 :)
